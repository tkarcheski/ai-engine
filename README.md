# AI Engine

## Overview
The **AI Engine** powers the AI-driven features of the AI Operating System. It handles procedural content generation, dynamic NPC behavior, and adaptive AI decision-making. The engine uses machine learning models to ensure real-time responsiveness in games and other applications, enhancing user experiences.

## Key Features
- **Procedural Content Generation**: Automatically generates environments, missions, and NPC behaviors.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses models to adapt NPC behavior based on player interactions.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Automates repetitive tasks like testing and data generation for developers.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **CI/CD**: pytest for testing, pip for dependency management

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tkarcheski/ai-engine.git
   ```
